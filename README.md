# Output
## Abstract
Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) is a rapidly evolving branch of AI that focuses on creating new content—text, images, audio, video—based on patterns learned from existing data. Central to this progress are Large Language Models (LLMs), which leverage transformer-based architectures to process and generate human-like language. This report explores the foundational principles of Generative AI, key architectures, applications, and the transformative impact of scaling LLMs. It also addresses their limitations, ethical concerns, and emerging trends.
